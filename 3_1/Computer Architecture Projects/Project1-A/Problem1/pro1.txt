sim-cheetah: This program implements a functional simulator driver for
Cheetah.  Cheetah is a cache simulation package written by Rabin Sugumar
and Santosh Abraham which can efficiently simulate multiple cache
configurations in a single run of a program.  Specifically, Cheetah can
simulate ranges of single level set-associative and fully-associative
caches.  See the directory libcheetah/ for more details on Cheetah.
